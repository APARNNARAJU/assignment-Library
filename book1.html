        <p class="text-dark" style="color: black;">
          <em>Sita: Warrior of Mithila</em> is the fifth book of Amish Tripathi,
           fifth book of Amishverse, and second book of Ram Chandra Series. 
           Ram Chandra Series is a retelling of the most famous epic of India, the Ramayana.
            Each book in the series focuses on one important character of the Ramayana.

        <p class="text-dark" style="color: black;"> During a trip Janak, the king of Mithila and his wife Sunaina 
          find a child on the road, being protected by a vulture. They adopt the child and name her Sita, 
          for she was found in a furrow. As an adolescent, Sita is sent to the ashram of Rishi Shvetaketu for her studies
          . There she learns about martial arts and gains knowledge on different subjects. She also makes friendship with 
           girl Radhika, and her cousin Hanuman, who was a Vayuputra—the tribe left by the previous Mahadev, Lord Rudra.
            He is also a Naga whose appearance looks like the head of a monkey placed on a human body. When Sita is 14 years old,
             Maharishi Vishvamitra—head of the Malayaputra tribe who serve the next Vishnu—visits Shvetaketu's ashram.
              Impressed by Sita's skills and knowledge (and a strange connection which he remembers due to the sound of a hill myna),
               he elects her as the seventh Vishnu but asks her to keep it a secret. Sita also wins the trust of Jatayu,
                a Naga member of the Malayaputras.</p>
