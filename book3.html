        <p class="text-dark" style="color: black;">
          <em>It </em> It is a 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King. 
          It was King's 22nd book and the 17th novel written under his own name. 
          The story follows the experiences of seven children terrorized by It (otherwise known as Pennywise),
           an evil entity that exploits the fears of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey.
        </p>
        <p class="text-dark" style="color: black;"> In 1978, King and his family lived in Boulder, Colorado.
           One evening, King ventured alone to pick up his car from the repair shop and came across an old wooden bridge,
          "humped and oddly quaint". Walking along the bridge caused King to recall the story of "Three Billy Goats Gruff", 
          and the idea of transplanting the tale's scenario into a real-life context interested him. 
          King was further inspired by a line by Marianne Moore—“imaginary gardens with real toads in 
          them"—which in his mind came out as "real trolls in imaginary gardens." King would return to the concept
           two years later and gradually accumulated ideas and thoughts, particularly the concept of weaving the narratives of 
          children and the adults they become. King began writing It in 1980,[2] and finished the book five years later. 
          King found influence in the mythology and history surrounding the construction of the sewer system in Bangor, Maine.</p>
